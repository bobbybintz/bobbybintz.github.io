        <head>Dear Jordan</head>
    <p>I understand if you never want to talk to or see me again. My intent with this letter is to say goodbye.</p>
    <p>&emsp;I have many fond memories of the time we spent together. I remember when I lived at oak st and you and Lacy would stop by. My favorite memory will always be when we played super Mario Odyssey together. I thought it was incredible that you were showing interest in me and something I liked. It was the first time we kissed. I remember the last time we kissed, watching the mandalorian. I remember new years eve 2020, inside the crown pub, I couldn’t believe you called. I remember many sunny days at horsetooth. On our most recent hike at horsetooth falls I was surprised about how much you moved around as a kid. I wish I could have heard more about your time in Japan. I won’t forget when you asked to stay in one of my spare rooms while we were paddle boarding at horsetooth. I’m so sorry we couldn’t figure out how to make living together work.</p>
	<p>&emsp;I’ve grown a lot since the first day you moved in. I think the biggest lesson I’ve learned is that my needs matter, and that I need to advocate for myself more. If there’s a conversation I need to have or if I need something from someone it’s on me to make sure that need is met. I think it will make me happier, and willing to compromise with those around me. My inability or unwillingness to speak up may lead to disingenuous actions that only serve to hurt the ones I care about, or scenarios in which I’m not happy. I’ve learned that the only opinion about me that matters is my own.</p>
	<p>&emsp;I hope you’ll sat goodbye to Nova for me, maybe give her a treat if she’s up for it. I’m sorry I wasn’t the best roommate to you. I may have pushed on your boundaries and I didn’t always act appropriately, particularly when drinks were involved. I acted jealous and attempted to control. Despite our struggles I look back at our friendship with a feeling of extreme fondness. It absolutely destroys me to have witnessed the trust fall out between us. I wish I could have held it together. I wish things could have been different and that we don’t have to say goodbye. Some things just cannot be though.</p>
	<p>&emsp;I’m grateful for the time we had together, and I am grateful the I knew you Jordan. It is with a heavy heart that I have to say goodbye.</p>
<t>&emsp;Sincerely, </t>
<p></p>
